# psychoCRFdemo
Illustration of how signal detection theory allows to extract a psychophysical contrast response function (CRF) from the threshold vs contrast (TvC) function.  
Psychophysical contrast response functions are generated from a transducer model and previously fitted parameters, then translated into threshold vs contrast psychophysical functions using signal detection theory. CRFs with and without a constant-contrast overlay mask are compared.

Model, threshold data and fits taken from [Meese, T. S., et al. (2007). "Contextual modulation involves suppression and facilitation from the center and the surround." Journal of Vision 7(4): 21.]. The modulated self-suppression model 3 is used along with data and fits from observer RHS.

## Instructions
- See doIt.m for the main script.

## Extra
doIt_crossOrientation.m : Replotting of data and fits to show how cross-oriented overlay masks at different contrasts can either facilitate or suppress contrast perception at threshold.
